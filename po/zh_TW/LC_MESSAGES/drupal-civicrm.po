msgid "The CiviCRM module stores information on the universe of people associated with a community and on their interactions such as emails, donations, petitions, events, etc. It can act as a stand alone contact management system or it can be integrated with mass mailer, volunteer management, petition, and event finding. CiviCRM enables organizations to maintain all these activities in a single database, creating efficiencies and new opportunities for communities to better communicate and benefit from relationships with their community members."
msgstr "CiviCRM 模組儲存所有與社群相關的人員資料，以及彼此的互動資訊，例如電子郵件、捐款、請願、活動等。可以把 CiviCRM 當成是一個獨立的聯絡人管理系統，也可以和其他郵件軟體、志工管理、請願和活動系統進行整合。CiviCRM 讓組織可以在單一資料庫裡管理所有的活動，替組織建立有效的、新的機會，以更好地與社群成員溝通。"

msgid "The CiviCRM module allows you to create contacts, or import them from other sources. You can record relationships between contacts, such as indicating they live in the same household. There are two types of groups of contacts. You can create static groups which have a set list of contacts. You can also create dynamic (smart) groups based on characteristics that contacts have in common. For example, you could create a group of all contacts who live in California AND who have volunteered for your organization within the past year. The CiviCRM module also allows for tagging for less formal categorization of contacts or groups. You can easily extend CiviCRM to record community member information which is specific to your community or organization using custom fields. For example, you can create a set of fields to track volunteer skills and preferences. CiviCRM profile gives you a way to allow community members ('users') to update their own information, as well as share some of that information with others. Finally, you can configure custom activity types such as volunteering or attending events."
msgstr "CiviCRM 模組讓你可以建立聯絡人，或是從其他來源匯入。你可以記錄聯絡人之間的關係，例如是否是同一個家庭。有兩種聯絡人群組，一種是靜態的聯絡人群組，或是根據聯絡人的特性來建立動態的聯絡人群組。例如：你可建立一個住在台北市、並且都曾經在去年擔任過志工的聯絡人群組。CiviCRM 也可以使用標籤功能，針對聯絡人或群組進行比較非正式的分類方式。你也可以使用 CiviCRM 的客製化欄位，來記錄與社群或組織相關的特定資料。例如：建立一組欄位來追蹤志工的技能或喜好。CiviCRM 的個人檔案，可以讓社群成員自行更新他們的資訊，並與他人分享一些資訊。你還可以自訂動態類型，例如擔任志工或參與活動。"
