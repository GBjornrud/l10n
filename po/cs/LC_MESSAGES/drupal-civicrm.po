msgid "The CiviCRM module stores information on the universe of people associated with a community and on their interactions such as emails, donations, petitions, events, etc. It can act as a stand alone contact management system or it can be integrated with mass mailer, volunteer management, petition, and event finding. CiviCRM enables organizations to maintain all these activities in a single database, creating efficiencies and new opportunities for communities to better communicate and benefit from relationships with their community members."
msgstr "CiviCRM modul uchovává informace o všech lidech spojených s komunitou a jejich činnosti jako jsou emaily, dary, petice, akce, atd. Může pracovat samostatně jako systém pro správu kontaktů nebo může být integrován se systémypro rozesílání emailů, řízení dobrovolníků, petic a správu akcí. CiviCRM umožňuje organizacím spravovat všechny tyto aktivity ve společné databázi a účinně podporovat komunikaci uvnitř komunity a posilovat vztahy mezi jednotlivými členy komunity."

msgid "The CiviCRM module allows you to create contacts, or import them from other sources. You can record relationships between contacts, such as indicating they live in the same household. There are two types of groups of contacts. You can create static groups which have a set list of contacts. You can also create dynamic (smart) groups based on characteristics that contacts have in common. For example, you could create a group of all contacts who live in California AND who have volunteered for your organization within the past year. The CiviCRM module also allows for tagging for less formal categorization of contacts or groups. You can easily extend CiviCRM to record community member information which is specific to your community or organization using custom fields. For example, you can create a set of fields to track volunteer skills and preferences. CiviCRM profile gives you a way to allow community members ('users') to update their own information, as well as share some of that information with others. Finally, you can configure custom activity types such as volunteering or attending events."
